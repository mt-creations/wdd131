            <p class="history">Our company was created in 2020, however our window cleaning roots go back much further in time.  Founder Michael Thomas grew up in a window cleaning family.  He worked for his fathers company climbing ladders and making customers happy all the way back in 1999.  Working alongside his brothers he learned the value of customer service and hard work. 20 years later he decided to carry on his fathers legacy and start up his own window cleaning business.
